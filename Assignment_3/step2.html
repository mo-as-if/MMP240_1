	<h1> Step 2: Performing the Trick </h1>
<p> Now that your front foot is in position with toes hanging off and back foot
  ready to pop, get ready to follow through. Begin by popping the board to lift
  it from the ground and then... JUMP! Jump as high as you can. The longer hang
  time you acheive while airborne, the more time you give your board to complete
  its rotation. As you jump, slide your front foot all the way across the board
  and when your foot reaches the nose of the board, flick your heel directly
  forward to cause the board to flip in front of you. The tricky part? Its to be
  all done in one motion. Pop - Jump - Slide front foot - Flick off the nose.
